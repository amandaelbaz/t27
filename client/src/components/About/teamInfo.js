I am in the general Computer Science concentration so I can dabble around in everything and have a more broad understanding of Computer Science and related fields and disciplines. After graduation, I hope to use my Arabic background and CS degree to work for the FBI or CIA and combine those two skills to work in new and developing AI security, ethical hacking, and many other things.",
